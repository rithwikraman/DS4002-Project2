The final dataset has the same columns as the original dataset except that the following 3 were dropped:
'Sub_metering_1', 'Sub_metering_2', 'Sub_metering_3'.
The dataset is too big to upload here; hence, you can obtain the dataset by running the last command of the script file
that converts our dataframe to a csv file and downloads it.
