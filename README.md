# DS4002 Project 2 - Household Power Consumption Prediction

## Team Mango:
* Rithwik Raman (xak7jw)
* Pranav Arora (aub5uy)
* Ayush Acharya (htb4hv)

## Description
### This repository contains our project's datasets, scripts, and generated visualizations. The project uses historical power consumption data to predict future usage, based on daily and seasonal trends. 

## Software and Platform (TODO -- update as necessary)
* Development was performed in a Python-based Jupyter notebook.
* The following Python packages were imported:
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * ARIMA
  * LSTM
* Scripts were run on the Google Colab Runtime Environment platform.

## Reproducing these Results
* Download the dataset from: https://github.com/rithwikraman/DS4002-Project1/blob/main/DATA/GPT_reviews.csv
* Download the LDA result dataset from: https://github.com/rithwikraman/DS4002-Project1/blob/main/DATA/Review_groups_output.csv
* Upload both datasets to your Google Colab Runtime Environment
* Update .read_csv() to the location of your GPT_reviews.csv dataset
* Run the scripts until cell 19. 
* Once you reach the LDA analysis portion within the script (Cell 19), update the read_csv() to the location of your Review_groups_output.csv
* Run the Jupyter Notebook and view the results
